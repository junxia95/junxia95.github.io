[Towards Energy-Aware Federated Learning via MARL: A Dual-Selection Approach for Model and Client](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08183)(EDA Top Conference, CCF-B iter, Acceptance Ratio: 24%)

**Jun Xia**, Yi Zhang, Yiyu Shi

[**Project**]([https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=K4JXEHUAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=K4JXEHUAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC)) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We propose an energy-aware FL framework named DR-FL, which considers the energy constraints in both clients and heterogeneous deep learning models to enable energy-efficient FL. Unlike Vanilla FL, DR-FL adopts our proposed Muti-Agents Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based dual-selection method, which allows participated devices to make contributions to the global model effectively and adaptively based on their computing capabilities and energy capacities in a MARL-based manner.

[Eliminating backdoor triggers for deep neural networks using attention relation graph distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.09975)(AI Top Conference, CCF-A iter, Acceptance Ratio: 14%)

**Jun Xia**, Ting Wang, Jiepin Ding, Xian Wei, Mingsong Chen

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We introduce a novel backdoor defense framework named Attention Relation Graph Distillation (ARGD), which fully explores the correlation among attention features with different orders using our proposed Attention Relation Graphs (ARGs). Based on the alignment of ARGs between both teacher and student models during knowledge distillation, ARGD can eradicate more backdoor triggers than NAD.

[PervasiveFL: Pervasive federated learning for heterogeneous IoT systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3489517.3530608)(EDA Top Journal, CCF-A iter, Acceptance Ratio: 23%)

**Jun Xia**, Tian Liu, Zhiwei Ling, Ting Wang, Xin Fu, Mingsong Chen

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- we propose a novel framework named PervasiveFL that enables efficient and effective FL among heterogeneous IoT devices. Without modifying original local models, PervasiveFL installs one lightweight NN model named modellet on each device. By using the deep mutual learning (DML) and our entropy-based decision gating (EDG) method, modellets and local models can selectively learn from each other through soft labels.
