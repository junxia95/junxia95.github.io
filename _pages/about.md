[WaveAttack: Asymmetric Frequency Obfuscation-based Backdoor Attacks Against Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11595)

**Jun Xia**, Zhihao Yue, Yingbo Zhou, Zhiwei Ling, Yiyu Shi, Xian Wei, Mingsong Chen

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- propose a novel frequency-based backdoor attack method named WaveAttack, which obtains image high-frequency features through Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to generate backdoor triggers.
- introduce an asymmetric frequency obfuscation method, which can add an adaptive residual in the training and inference stage to improve the impact of triggers and further enhance the effectiveness of WaveAttack.
